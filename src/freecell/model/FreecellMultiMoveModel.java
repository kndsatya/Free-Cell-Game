/**
 * Represents a multi move model which is nothing but a  Free cell model
 * that allows movement of multiple cards at a time from one cascade pile
 * to another cascade pile. (while it is also possible to move several cards from
 * a cascade pile to a foundation pile, we will ignore this feature in this variation).
 *
 * <p>Moving multiple cards must obey two conditions. The first condition is that they should
 * form a valid build, i.e. they should be arranged in alternating colors and consecutive,
 * descending values in the cascade pile that they are moving from. The second condition is
 * the same for any move to a cascade pile: these cards should form a build with the last card
 * in the destination cascade pile.</p>
 *
 * <p>It may be noted that the ability of moving cards (besides the two conditions above)
 * is not a special feature, but a convenience to the player. A multi-card move is
 * basically several single-card moves, using free open piles and empty cascade piles
 * as ‚Äúintermediate slots‚Äù. Thus a multi-card move may not be feasible even though it
 * obeys the above two conditions, if there aren‚Äôt enough of these intermediate slots.
 * More specifically, it can be proved that the maximum number of cards that can be moved
 * when there are ùëÅ free open piles and ùêæ empty cascade piles is (ùëÅ+1)‚àó2ùêæ. Your implementation
 * of this variation should work within all these three conditions.</p>
 *
 * <p>In order to use an empty cascade pile as an intermediary for multi-card moves,
 * we will allow any card to move to an empty cascade pile (not just a king,
 * as some Freecell versions mandate).</p>
