This contains two different versions of Freecell game using MVC architecture in Java. Unlike the standard game of Freecell - which contains a fixed number of cascade, open and foundation piles, this application gives the user an option to choose the number of open and cascade piles. This feature was modeled in the application using the "Builder Design Pattern". 

The basic version of the game would support only the single move of cards, whereas, in the advanced version, the multi-move feature was introduced to move the cards between the cascade piles.
